# pose-based-EKF-slam.github.io
A study on pose-based SLAM using EKF for robot localization, specifically focusing on a differential drive robot equipped with Lidar, IMU, and wheel velocity sensors. The mapping algorithm utilized is Iterative Closest Point (ICP), while the Extended Kalman filter is employed for state estimation.
